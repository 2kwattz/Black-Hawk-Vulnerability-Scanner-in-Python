# Black-Hawk-Vulnerability-Scanner-in-Python
##### Black Hawk is a vulnerability scanner for Kali Linux, Just like a reconnaissance mission for your system, searching for potential weak spots that could be exploited by adversaries. Think of it as your "radar" detecting vulnerabilities in your defenses

##### As of my last update, Only Ping Connection Scan & OS Detection Scan is functional, Rest of the features would be added soon

#### The scanning tool manipulates the TTL value in IP packets to determine the operating system of a remote host based on how it responds to different TTL values. Here's a basic rundown of the process:

##### Understanding TTL: TTL is a field in the IP header that represents the number of hops (routers) a packet can pass through before being discarded. Each router decrements the TTL value by at least 1 before forwarding the packet.
Normal TTL Behavior: When a packet reaches its destination, the TTL should expire, causing the destination to send back an ICMP Time Exceeded message.
TTL Manipulation: During the TTL scan, the scanning tool sends packets with varying TTL values. It starts with a TTL value of 1 and increments it with each subsequent packet.
Analyzing Responses: By observing how the target responds to the TTL-limited packets, the scanning tool can infer the operating system. Different operating systems may handle TTL expiration differently:
