# Black-Hawk-Vulnerability-Scanner-in-Python
Black Hawk is a vulnerability scanner for Kali Linux, Just like a reconnaissance mission for your system, searching for potential weak spots that could be exploited by adversaries. Think of it as your "radar" detecting vulnerabilities in your defenses

#### As of my last update, Only Ping Connection Scan & OS Detection Scan is functional, Rest of the features would be added soon
